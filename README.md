## About
Hello and thank you for using SLIDDES Software.
SLIDDES Unity Debug is a collection for debugging in Unity. It currently contains:
- Debug Console, for debugging in editor or in build. Easily add custom commands to it for your personal needs.

## Installation
You can install it as a package for Unity.

For more information on how to install it:
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html

## How To Use It
1. After installing add an empty GameObject to the scene. Name it Debug Console (or whatever you like).
2. Click on the GameObject > Go to the inspector view > click Add Component and add the DebugConsole script.
3. You can now access the Debug Console in play-mode or build with ` / ~ / F6.
4. You can type 'help' in the console bar for more information and 'commands' for a list of all commands availabe
6. Thats it!
Note: There can only be 1 DebugConsole per scene, the DebugConsole handles this itself by destroying itself if another
DebugConsole is already active in the scene. You can add a DebugConsole for every scene if you like or just 1 in your
build index 0 scene (your start scene) since the DebugConsole is in DontDestroyOnLoad.
