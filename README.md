## About
Hello and thank you for using SLIDDES Software.
SLIDDES Unity Debug is a collection for debugging in Unity. It currently contains:
- Debug Console, for debugging in editor or in build. Easily add custom commands to it for your personal needs.

## Installation
You can install it as a package for Unity.

For more information on how to install it:
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html

## How To Use It
1. After installing add an empty GameObject to the scene. Name it Debug Console (or whatever you like).
2. Click on the GameObject > Go to the inspector view > click Add Component and add the DebugConsole script.
3. You can now access the Debug Console in play-mode or build with ` / ~ / F6.
4. You can type 'help' in the console bar for more information and 'commands' for a list of all commands availabe
6. Thats it!
Note: There can only be 1 DebugConsole per scene, the DebugConsole handles this itself by destroying itself if another
DebugConsole is already active in the scene. You can add a DebugConsole for every scene if you like or just 1 in your
build index 0 scene (your start scene) since the DebugConsole is in DontDestroyOnLoad.

## Adding custom commands
For a full explanation on creating a custom command class, navigate to Packages > SLIDDES Debug > Samples > [SampleCustomCommand.cs](https://github.com/MrSliddes/SLIDDES-Unity-Debug/blob/main/Samples/SampleCustomCommand.cs) (Dont forget to untoggle package visalility if Packages folder where to be empty) or see it [here](https://github.com/MrSliddes/SLIDDES-Unity-Debug/blob/main/Samples/SampleCustomCommand.cs).
1. Create a .cs script anywhere in your /Assets/ folder named 'MyCustomCommand1'
2. Add this code to 'MyCustomCommand1'
```
// How a CustomCommand class should look like:
// How a CustomCommand class should look like:
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using SLIDDES.Debug;

public class MyCustomCommand1 : CustomCommand
{
    public static DebugCommand CUSTOM_COMMAND;

    public override void Invoke()
    {
        CUSTOM_COMMAND = new DebugCommand("my_custom_command", "The description of my_custom_command", "my_custom_command", () =>
        {
            // Your command excecution code goes here
            UnityEngine.Debug.Log("Executed my_custom_command");
        });

        commands = new List<object>()
        {
          CUSTOM_COMMAND
        };
    }
}
```
3. When starting playmode the console should say that it loaded 1 custom command(s)
4. Type 'my_custom_command' to see the command in action (printing "Executed my_custom_command")
